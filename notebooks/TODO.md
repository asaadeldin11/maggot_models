- Rerun diff sort on simulation code
    - clearly show when it breaks 

- Rerun diff sort on whole graph 
    - pay attention to nans/0s, see what it looks like 

- Take the synthetic model fit, try diff sort and the other methods 

- Give a few clear examples of the clustering/similarity on fwd/reverse cascades

- (if time) rerun voltage stuff
