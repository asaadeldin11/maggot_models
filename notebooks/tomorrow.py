# TODO generate new data from michael
# TODO run random walks on new data, look for places where things still die.
# TODO ask jovo about this issue where later layers are meaningless...
# TODO think if it is worth doing commute time... is this even what they want
# TODO what about other transformations of the adjacency, like exponentiate synapse thingy?
# TODO ask jovo about subclustering the louvain
# TODO get the labels for MBONs they keep saying might be okay with breaking off
# TODO think - what does exponentiating markov matrix give me... just probability of paths of a certain length?
# TODO can we just compare decay spectra for a given neuron somehow?
