# questions

- input / output / inner 
    - what 
- keep only A->D neurons
    - neurons or edges?
- identify "latent structure" (clustering, should be feedforward)
    - how shoulw we constrain the clustering to be "feedforward"?
- then add others synapse types, how does structure change?

----

- look at PN -> KC "pattern"
- is that "pattern" present elsewhere?
- where in the brain do L and R NOT match

- central complex
    - why do they care about this?
- circuit motif discovery
    - how?

- are there any other groups of neurons "like" kenyon cells
- eg, that they can't be uniquely identified for some reason (eg, doesn't exist on other hemisphere)
  - most other cells are individually matched across brain.

----

- we can directly send results also to AC/MZ
    - I think I have been?

-----

- ch 1: 3 layers, what structure is in there?
    - what are the 3 layers?
- ch 2: 4 colors, what kind of circuit motifs are there together and different?

-----

- how is larval different from adult??
    - does this mean we will have the adult data?

- cross hemispheric differences
- inter-hemisphere
- synapse type differences
- multi-sensory/inner/motor  (the adults don't have the complete proprioceptive)
- efference copy  / proprioceptive

do we have the labels? modality? input? output?
    - we know sensory modality for PN and thats all they have given us 

help AC a lot in short term:

- color the pathways, these are 21 ORNs, etc. color each group,
    - what does color each group mean
- see the merged colors, which neurons are getting input from each of these types of inputs,
    - I could certainly look at the proprotion of input onto a non PN from each PN type
- until eventually reaching the command neurons?
- how is MB injected into these paths of convergence?
- AC expects: 2 groups, regular sensory, the other is mostly proprioceptive which has its own circuits
    - proprioceptive should be coming from the other direction?
- the "larvunculous".
    - what's that
- closer to output layer proprioceptive convergences with other sensory
- there are 12 segments, somatosensory neurons is largest, each segment with 40 per hemisphere, so 40x2x12 = 100 neurons!
    - are you talking about lower in the body?

- efference copies:
  
  - the descending neurons which also project into the brain?
  - neurons that synapse onto the descending neurons?
  - eg, output and input of descending neurons

- stratified thing, AC expects layers (only clear layers are input and output layers), between these layers there will be feedback.  much of this feedback is A->A, that is, subsequent layer impacts previous layer via A->A
    - why do they think this?
- how many layers? maybe 6 or 7, but there are shortcuts.
- what is the diameter of the graph? expectation: 10 for A->D.

- feedback?
- are there hubs? is it a powerlaw?w
    - powerlaw degree distribution?
- we can also compare to c. elegans!
    - cool, scott's?

- Q1: what is info flow from input to output?
- Q2: you can have many parallel pathways *per* layer?
